Key Steps to Train and Use an LLM for MOM Generation:
Dataset Preparation:

Collect and preprocess a dataset of transcripts along with corresponding MOM documents. This serves as the training data.
Ensure the dataset captures diverse meeting types, formats, and writing styles.
Model Selection:

Choose a pre-trained LLM, such as OpenAI's GPT, Google's T5, or any fine-tunable LLM like BERT-based models.
Fine-tune the model on your dataset for the MOM generation task.
Fine-Tuning the LLM:

Split your data into training and validation sets.
Train the model to learn patterns between the input transcript and the output MOM structure.
Post-Processing:

Implement post-processing to structure the generated MOM into sections like agenda, discussion points, suggestions, and conclusions.
Deployment:

Set up a pipeline to input raw meeting transcripts and generate structured MOM automatically.
